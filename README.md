```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
```

## Environment Variables

### Frontend Environment Variables

1. Copy the example file:
```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure the following variables in `frontend/.env`:
- `VITE_BASE_PATH`: Base path for the application (default: `/`)
  - For local development, use `/` (root path)
  - Only change if you need a different base path

### Backend Environment Variables

1. Copy the example file:
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure the following variables in `backend/.env`:
- `PORT`: Server port (default: `5000`)
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token signing and verification
  - **IMPORTANT**: Change this to a secure random string in production
  - Generate a secure key: `openssl rand -base64 32`

**Note**: For Vite projects, environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the frontend code.

## Demo Login

For the demo version (localStorage):
- **Email**: `admin@example.com`
